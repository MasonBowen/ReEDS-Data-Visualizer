# Created by ReEDS-India team 10/2018 - 12/2018 (Amy Rose, David Palchak, Ilya Chernyakhovskiy, Thomas Bowen)

# Welcome to the ReEDS Interactive Visualization Tool!
# Please address all concerns/comments/suggestions to Thomas Bowen

# For the set up, please refer to the README.txt file in the same directory as this script


# Notes to users: 

#         1) You may need to change the 'base.directory' variable below to point R to the proper folder(s)
#               The base directory should have 4 subfolders: '/basic data/', '/functions/', '/server/' and '/ui/'
# 
#         2) You may also need to go into the 'start_gdxr.R' file and change the 'gams.folder' location so that it 
#             points to your installation of gams

gams.directory <- "/../../../../../../Program Files (x86)/GAMS/win64" # should point to your installation of GAMS

base.directory <- "ReEDS - Visualization Tool"         # should point to the folder where all this data is stored (relative to current directory)

functions.directory <- file.path(base.directory, "functions") # Should point to folder with all non-shiny scripts

basicdata.directory <- file.path(base.directory, "basic data") # Should point to folder with all the csv data

server.directory <- file.path(base.directory, "server") # Should point to folder with all shiny-server scripts

ui.directory <- file.path(base.directory, "ui") # Should point to folder with all shiny-ui scripts

data.folder <- "../capexp-india/ReEDS-2.0/gdxfiles" # should point to location of '.gdx' files

scenarios <- gsub(c(list.files(data.folder, pattern = "\\.gdx$")), # here you can select which scenarios you are interested in
                  pattern = "\\.gdx$", replacement = "",

shape.file.loc <- file.path(basicdata.directory, "mapping/IND_adm1gadmFinal_wKashWhole_WGS84.shp") # This should point directly to .shp file
# NOTE for now this is specific to India in that it excludes "Andaman_Nicobar" and "Lakshadweep" if you want to change this navigate
# to the 'mapping_data_and_functions.R' script

# --------------------------------------------- /
# Load in necessary functions, .RDS objects and .csv files
# --------------------------------------------- /

source(file.path(functions.directory, "read_basic_gdx_info.R"))
# This script executs 4 main tasks:
# 
#       1) runs a script 'create_gdx_str_list.R' which creates a list (gdx.structure) with the naming conventions we 
#           expect from GAMS and the naming convention we want to replace it with, this list is saved 
#           to the 'basic data/' folder after it's created so that you can examine it (with the 'readRDS()' function);
# 
#       2) runs a script 'gdxr_functions.R' which loads all functions needed by 'gdx_extract_all' 
#           function (below) to interact with the gdx files directly;
# 
#       3) runs a script 'start_gdxr.R' which will actually start up the gdxrrw package,
#             NOTE: you might have to change a directory or two here depending on where your GAMS folder is 
#             so that R can find your copy of GAMS;
# 
#       4) loads 2 functions which are used to interact with the .gdx files once they are loaded into R


###
source(file.path(functions.directory, "gdx_extract_all.R"))
# This script loads a function 'gdx_extract_all()' which will extract ALL of the data present in the 'gdx.structure' 
#     list (loaded above) from ALL of the given gdx files in the scenarios variable


###
source(file.path(functions.directory, "read_basic_nongdx_info.R"))
# This script loads the csv's which contain data on the states and technology types, the years and the 
#     color coordination for the data and plots. 
#     NOTE: These csv's will allow non-R users to manipulate how the data is rearranged and aggregated
#           for the technologies and state data, there is a column for user defined aggregations


###
source(file.path(functions.directory, "mapping_data.R"))
# This script reads in the shape file and formats it a bit


###
source(file.path(basicdata.directory, "plot_parameters.R"))
# This script loads some basic plotting parameters (as a list), 
# so far this is all R files, but my intention is to change this over to a csv for non-r-user manipulation


###
source(file.path(functions.directory, "plot_data_simplification.R"))
# This script loads in a series of functions all of which are used to process the data before plotting
# see actual script for more description


###
source(file.path(functions.directory, "plot_functions.R"))
# This script loads in a series of functions for plotting
# see actual script for more description


###
source(file.path(functions.directory, "sub_select_csv.R"))
# This script loads a function 'select_cat_col_cat_ord()' which takes the csv files loaded above and user-inputs from the shiny
#     to create a list of data.tables with the original values and the new desired values. This lsit is then used by the functions 
#     loaded in the "plot_data_simplification.R" to process/simplify the data


# --------------------------------------------- /
# Load in gdx files
# --------------------------------------------- /

# The below variable contains all the gdx data specified by the 'gdx.structure' list loaded above
# This can take a bit based on the number of scenarios being loaded in
# If you are feeling brave, set parallel = TRUE to activate parallel computing to speed up loading of data
# 5 scenarios = ~40 seconds with parallel = FALSE and ~15 seconds with parallel = TRUE

# NOTE IF YOU RUN parallel = TRUE, YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY CHANGE several directories in ''gdx_extract_all.R'
